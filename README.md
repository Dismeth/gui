In partial fulfilment for the requiremenets of MSc Management & IT @ University of St Andrews.

This is the repository for the graphical user interface of the analysis of the data set used, in order to predict the consumers' purchasing decisions.

The application is written in Python 2.7 using Kivy 1.9.1 as GUI library. Anaconda (4.0.0) is used as the platform for Python and the other libraries used (such as scikit-learn) preprocessing, analysing and plotting the data set.

Features:
- Please see the full report for features list.

Requirements:
- Python 2.7
- Kivy 1.9.2
- Anaconda 4.0 or equivelant (sklearn, scipy, matplotlib)
- Seaborn 0.7
- XGBoost >= 0.4

The most important requirements are Python, Kivy and Anaconda (or equivelant w/sklearn, scipy, matplotlib). XGBoost and Seaborn can be removed from the source files, and the application would still run.
